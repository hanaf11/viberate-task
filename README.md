# Task

Develop Artist page together with primary navigation using data from Mocky API (Primary navigation and Artist detail). Usage of React hooks is a must. Navigation should lead to Detail page of Each of three Artists. 

Please note that code should be well organized and structured in Components. Components should be put in folders. Additionally use at least one useReducer, useContext and useEffect hooks. Use Axios library for data access.

Use attached css/html/image files in folder html-css-sample.  For "Most popular in" section, use Nivo rocks library: https://nivo.rocks/
